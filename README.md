# au2019-unity-fbx-bim

A Template Unity project for loading FBX files containing Revit models exported from 3ds Max based on the Unity 3D With Extras template released with Unity 2019.2. This project was developed for the AU2019 class https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Real-Time-Importing-BIM-XR-3ds-Max-and-Unity-2019. 

This template contains an FBX Post Processor script that extracts BIM data or other 3ds Max user properties from an FBX file. When a Revit file is imported into 3ds Max all BIM Revit data is made available as object properties. See: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/community/screencast/7423e85b-143f-42f9-951e-49692c51d24c for an example.
